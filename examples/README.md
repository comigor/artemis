# **Examples**

This folder contains some examples on how to use artemis.

## [**pokemon**](./pokemon)

A simple example, showing [Pokémon GraphQL](https://graphql-pokemon.now.sh/) schema generation.

## [**graphqbrainz**](./graphbrainz)

A more complex example, for [graphbrainz](https://graphbrainz.herokuapp.com) (a MusicBrainz GraphQL server). Featuring union types, interfaces and custom scalars.

## [**github**](./github)

Even simpler example, for [GitHub GraphQL API](https://graphbrainz.herokuapp.com). I didn't commit the schema because it's too big (~3MB), so provide your own if you're running the example.
